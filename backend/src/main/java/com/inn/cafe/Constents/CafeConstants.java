/**
 * This class holds all the constant values used throughout the Cafe application.
 * Constants are used to store fixed values like messages and paths that don't change.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to avoid repeating the same values in multiple places,
 * making the code cleaner and easier to maintain. Whenever a constant value is needed,
 * we can refer to this class, ensuring consistency across the application.
